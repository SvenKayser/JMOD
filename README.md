### si.core

This mod implements a powerful configuration engine. It also implements the foundation of the Survival Industry mining progression, as well as a custom vanilla-style metal alloying method.

Configuration can be found after first run in your config folder in the file si.core.json.

The mod as of now is not feature complete and in alpha development, but versions found here are generally working. Note: even tho the mod is basically designed to run in a library-only-mode, I discourage building anything upon this. The API is very likely to change a lot before becoming somewhat stable.
